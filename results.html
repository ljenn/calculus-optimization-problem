	<p>So now that we know Parker has to travel 62.45 meters to reach her desired location, we can calculate the amount of time for her to get there.
</p><br />
        <p>Remember: She travels at a rate of 50 meters per 10 minutes, or 5 meters per minute (wow, slow), and has to rest 1 minute after 50 meters. 
</p><br />
	<p>Using basic algebra to add this up, this would mean she would take 10 minutes traveling the first 50 meters, 1 minute to rest, and 2 minutes and 29.4 seconds to finish the remaining 12.45 meters. 
</p><br />
	<p>That's a total of 13 minutes and 29.4 seconds to get to her desired spot. BUT, we would have to double that for the roundtrip, which means travel time is 26 minutes and 58.8 seconds. If she wants to spend 45 minutes at the reef, Parker will either have to learn to swim normally or go for the rental.
</p><br />
	<p>Side Question: Is one hour enough for her at this rate? Will she get away with the cheaper route or will she get caught and get into trouble? Should she just pay the $40 instead of suspiciously doing things her own way?
</p><br />
	<p>An hour is not enough. She might as well pay $40 for the rental to avoid trouble and she technically <i>should</i> just support the rental place; after all, she'll probably be selling her pictures for profit in the end.
</p><br />
	<p>Of course, what Parker chooses is entirely up to her.
