          <div class="contentText"><p>In an island far far away, there laid a beautiful ocean spread across the horizons. From an underwater view, the island was layered with breathtaking coral reefs waiting to be discovered by a courageous explorer.</p><br />
        <p>Actually, the island was more of the coast. It's somewhat far away since it's imaginary, though the ocean is still beautiful. And these reefs--they were already discovered.</p><br />
	<p>Lining the coast underwater, these vibrant reefs are 60 meters deep and about 5 meters in height.</p><br />
	<p>Parker, a female photographer, decides to capture a few snapshots of this exotic reef from faraway. She decides that snorkeling is the best method and wants to capture the <u><b>largest possible view</b></u> of the reefs--the best view.</p><br />
<p>However, there's an issue. Parker doesn't want to pay the snorkeling rental, which is a whopping $40 for one hour, when she only wants to stay out there for about 45 minutes. So she purchases $20 worth of swim goggles and a life vest from a shabby store down the street.</p><br />
	<p>Unfortunately, this causes a couple more issues:<br>
<ol>
<li>Parker has to swim to her desired spot and back to the coastline in one hour because a security boat makes its rounds every hour.
<li>Parker is a terrible athlete; she can't swim. She can only doggy paddle and that will take her approximately 10 minutes every 50 meters. And she has to rest for 1 minute every 50 meters.
</ol>
</p><br />
	<p>Nevertheless, Parker is unperturbed. She gears up and jumps in from one of the more deserted areas on the coastline.</p><br />

            <div class="contentText">
	<p><ol>
<li><b>At what distance, will she receive the largest possible view of the reefs?</b>
<li>Side Question: Is one hour enough for her at this rate? Will she get away with the cheaper route or will she get caught and get into trouble? Should she just pay the $40 instead of suspiciously doing things her own way?
</ol>
